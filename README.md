# Tkinter Testing
 A program that is the culmination of all my knowledge in Programming

Hello again (lol). Today we are gonna do some stuff with my __K N O W L E D G E__ in python with Tkinter and other modules.

# Hey Kiwi, what is this?
 This project is a project that I have going since I started Python Tkinter, so expect A ton of useless stuff here

To be honest, this project has like...4 updates and it never got a repo. Since I got VSCode and GitHub to cooperate (with a gun in their heads, naturally), I can write Markdown _and_ look at the changes without changing the tabs (also my fancy git thingy extensions are cool.<sub> I LOVE YOU GITLENS</sub>)

Anyways, with that out of the way, here are some Updates in the app. If you call sus on the releases, you can just check the source, idc

# Latest Changes
- Added the feature to pick a random pastables
- Added like, 35 different pastables
- Changed paste picker button (under Clipboard) from "Copy to Clipboard" to "Give me a random thing to paste"
- Alongside the above change, paste picker changed position in window
- I *might* expand the window from 500 x 500 to something else
- Changed README header "Changes" to "Latest Changes" to avoid confusion later on
- Edited README header "Tkinter Testing" content. Look at the commit for more details as to _what_ was edited
- Renoved Unanswered question on README

# To Do
- Add custom cursor (aside the circular cursor, probably, an android-looking cursor)
