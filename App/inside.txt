Hello, and thank you so much for downloading/running this program

This program is a compilation of what I learned in Python's Tkinter Module and many more,
so you may see yourself that the program is utterly useless.

There's not much to say really, since again, this is a compilation of what I learned so far.

So, ummmm...thank you for trying this program out?
