# Tkinter Testing
 A program that is the culmination of all my knowledge in Programming
Hello again (lol). Today we are gonna do some stuff with my __K N O W L E D G E__ in python with Tkinter.

# Hey Kiwi, what is this?
 This project is a project that I have going since I started Python Tkinter, so expect A ton of useless stuff here

To be honest, this project has like...4 updates and it never got a repo. Since I got VSCode and GitHub to cooperate (with a gun in their heads, naturally), I can write Markdown _and_ look at the changes without changing the tabs (also my fancy git thingy extensions are cool.<sub> I LOVE YOU GITLENS</sub>)

Anyways, with that out of the way, here are some Updates in the app. If you call sus on the releases, you can just check the source, idc

# Changes
- Added Clipboard Copy feature
- Added App Properties in main window
- Added Button for extra app info in case of troubleshooting
- Added Dependency Tree for more info in the readme (pressing the "About the Program" button)

# To Do
- Add custom cursor (aside the circular cursor, probably, an android-looking cursor)

Also, why everything in my "Apps" folder have a "U" in it?
